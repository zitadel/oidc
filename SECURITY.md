## Reporting a vulnerability

To file a incident, please disclose by email to security@zitadel.com with the security details.

At the moment GPG encryption is no yet supported, however you may sign your message at will.

### When should I report a vulnerability

* You think you discovered a ...
  * ... potential security vulnerability in the SDK
  * ... vulnerability in another project that this SDK bases on
* For projects with their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure process, please report it directly there

### When should I NOT report a vulnerability

* You need help applying security related updates
* Your issue is not security related

## Security Vulnerability Response

TBD

## Public Disclosure

All accepted and mitigated vulnerabilities will be published on the [Github Security Page](https://github.com/zitadel/oidc/security/advisories)

### Timing

We think it is crucial to publish advisories `ASAP` as mitigations are ready. But due to the unknown nature of the disclosures the time frame can range from 7 to 90 days.
