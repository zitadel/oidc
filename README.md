## What Is It

This project is a easy to use client (RP) and server (OP) implementation for the `OIDC` (Open ID Connect) standard written for `Go`.

The RP is certified for the [basic](https://www.certification.openid.net/plan-detail.html?public=true&plan=uoprP0OO8Z4Qo) and [config](https://www.certification.openid.net/plan-detail.html?public=true&plan=AYSdLbzmWbu9X) profile.

Whenever possible we tried to reuse / extend existing packages like `OAuth2 for Go`.

## How To Use It

Check the `/example` folder where example code for different scenarios is located.

```bash
# start oidc op server
# oidc discovery http://localhost:9998/.well-known/openid-configuration
CAOS_OIDC_DEV=1 go run github.com/caos/oidc/example/server/default
# start oidc web client
CLIENT_ID=web CLIENT_SECRET=web ISSUER=http://localhost:9998/ SCOPES=openid PORT=5556 go run github.com/caos/oidc/example/client/app
```

- browser http://localhost:5556/login will redirect to op server
- input id to login
- redirect to client app display user info

## Why another library

As of 2020 there are not a lot of `OIDC` library's in `Go` which can handle server and client implementations. CAOS is strongly committed to the general field of IAM (Identity and Access Management) and as such, we need solid frameworks to implement services.

### Goals

- [Certify this library as OP](https://openid.net/certification/#OPs)

### Other Go OpenID Connect libraries

[https://github.com/coreos/go-oidc](https://github.com/coreos/go-oidc)

The `go-oidc` does only support `RP` and is not feasible to use as `OP` that's why we could not rely on `go-oidc`

[https://github.com/ory/fosite](https://github.com/ory/fosite)

We did not choose `fosite` because it implements `OAuth 2.0` on its own and does not rely on the golang provided package. Nonetheless this is a great project.
