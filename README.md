## What Is It

This project is an easy-to-use client (RP) and server (OP) implementation for the `OIDC` (OpenID Connect) standard written for `Go`.

The RP is certified for the [basic](https://www.certification.openid.net/plan-detail.html?public=true&plan=uoprP0OO8Z4Qo) and [config](https://www.certification.openid.net/plan-detail.html?public=true&plan=AYSdLbzmWbu9X) profile.

Whenever possible we tried to reuse / extend existing packages like `OAuth2 for Go`.

## Basic Overview

The most important packages of the library:
<pre>
/pkg
    /client     clients using the OP for retrieving, exchanging and verifying tokens       
        /rp     definition and implementation of an OIDC Relying Party (client)
        /rs     definition and implementation of an OAuth Resource Server (API)
    /op         definition and implementation of an OIDC OpenID Provider (server)
    /oidc       definitions shared by clients and server

/example
    /api        example of an api / resource server implementation using token introspection
    /app        web app / RP demonstrating authorization code flow using various authentication methods (code, PKCE, JWT profile)
    /github     example of the extended OAuth2 library, providing an HTTP client with a reuse token source
    /service    demonstration of JWT Profile Authorization Grant
    /server     example of an OpenID Provider implementation including some very basic login UI
</pre>

## How To Use It

Check the `/example` folder where example code for different scenarios is located.

```bash
# start oidc op server
# oidc discovery http://localhost:9998/.well-known/openid-configuration
go run github.com/zitadel/oidc/example/server
# start oidc web client
CLIENT_ID=web CLIENT_SECRET=secret ISSUER=http://localhost:9998 SCOPES="openid profile" PORT=9999 go run github.com/zitadel/oidc/example/client/app
```

- open http://localhost:9999/login in your browser
- you will be redirected to op server and the login UI 
- login with user `test-user` and password `verysecure`
- the OP will redirect you to the client app, which displays the user info

## Supported Go Versions

For security reasons, we only support and recommend the use of one of the latest two Go versions (:white_check_mark:).  
Versions that also build are marked with :warning:.

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| <1.15   | :x:                |
| 1.15    | :warning:          |
| 1.16    | :warning:          |
| 1.17    | :warning:          |
| 1.18    | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.19    | :white_check_mark: |

## Why another library

As of 2020 there are not a lot of `OIDC` library's in `Go` which can handle server and client implementations. ZITADEL is strongly committed to the general field of IAM (Identity and Access Management) and as such, we need solid frameworks to implement services.

### Goals

- [Certify this library as OP](https://openid.net/certification/#OPs)

### Other Go OpenID Connect libraries

[https://github.com/coreos/go-oidc](https://github.com/coreos/go-oidc)

The `go-oidc` does only support `RP` and is not feasible to use as `OP` that's why we could not rely on `go-oidc`

[https://github.com/ory/fosite](https://github.com/ory/fosite)

We did not choose `fosite` because it implements `OAuth 2.0` on its own and does not rely on the golang provided package. Nonetheless this is a great project.
